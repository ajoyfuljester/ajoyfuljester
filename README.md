Hi, there


### i am

- a joyful jester
- stubborn and i do not like change, i try to use it to my advantage by creating good habits. i am not very good at this apparently
- dumb and stupid
- a human âˆ¨ an imagined persona, i do not know to be honest, perhaps someone i want to be
- someone who hates homework a lot, see [this](https://github.com/ajoyfuljester/habit-keeper/commit/05f0967ec5a6b03ff5246ff8892cfb1bd1163a44)


### things i like

- computer networks
- api
- programming
- detactive comics
- creativity, does not mean i'm good at it
- free(dom) software
- math
- water
- buses
- writing emails
- and probably more that i forgot about

### a few notes

- i might be delusional but [things to do](#things-to-do) are not of my delusions
- language is hard, communication is difficult
- my kind of philosophy is that i'm just a stranger that wants to make you smile, though it does not mean i am good at it
- i wish you a good life whatever it means
- when i write sorry in the commit messages, i'm sorry for not programming enough, that's because i want the green squares, see [section i am, second entry](#i-am)
